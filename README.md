# Employee-Management-System

## Description
This is an Employee Management System application designed to manage employee data. The application stores the first name, last name, and email of employees.

I have implemented a pagination feature, allowing users to navigate through the entries. Users can use buttons like "Next" to see the next page of entries and "Last" to view the last page. Additionally, numerical options are available to go directly to a specific page.

## Tools used
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Maven
- JPA/Hibernate
- Thymeleaf
- MySQL
